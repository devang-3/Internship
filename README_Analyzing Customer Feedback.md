 **Customer Feedback Dashboard â€“ Summary of Process**

### **1. Data Preparation**

* Collected customer feedback and organized it by common themes such as **Delivery**, **Product Quality**, **Customer Service**, **Pricing**, and **Packaging**.
* For each theme, two key metrics were calculated:

  * **Mentions**: How many times customers talked about this theme.
  * **Average CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)**: How satisfied customers were with each area on a scale of 1 to 5.

### **2. Visualizing Insights**

Two types of charts were used to turn this data into visual insights:

* A **bar chart** showing which themes customers mentioned the most.
* A **line chart** showing how satisfied customers were with each theme.

These charts were **combined into a single dashboard** to give a complete view of:

* What customers talk about most often.
* How happy they are with each part of the experience.

### **3. Business Value**

This dashboard helps decision-makers:

* Spot **pain points** (e.g., low satisfaction in Delivery or Packaging).
* Highlight **strengths** (e.g., high satisfaction in Product Quality).
* Make **data-driven decisions** to improve customer experience, prioritize issues, and enhance product or service offerings.
